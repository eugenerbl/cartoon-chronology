# Cartoon Chronology
An interactive web page that chronicles my favorite animated TV shows.

Click on a title to learn more about each cartoon!

All the information can be changed by editing a single Excel file! 

Each cartoon is represented by its own modal. Data from each cartoon comes from an Excel file, which is then converted to a JSON file in `scripts.js` and added into the appropriate modal.
